# MyToolbox Repository

Welcome to **MyToolbox**, a growing collection of Python scripts and tools as I progress through my learning journey. This repository serves as a space to document my practical applications of Python and problem-solving skills.

## Learning Journey

This repository is inspired by the following resources:

### Books:

- _Python Crash Course_ by Eric Matthes
- _Python Distilled_ by David Beazley
- _Impractical Python Projects_ by Lee Vaughan
- _Grokking Algorithms_ by Aditya Bhargava

As I continue to learn, I'll add scripts, tools, and projects based on these resources and real-world applications.

## Current Status

The repository currently contains a simple **Hello World** script as a starting point. As I build more tools, I will share them here with proper documentation.

## Follow My Journey

I am documenting my learning process, including challenges and successes, on my blog. Follow along for detailed walkthroughs and insights:

## Whatâ€™s Next?

As I progress, I will:

- Add tools and projects that apply Python fundamentals and advanced concepts.
- Share detailed explanations and learning insights on my blog.
- Expand the repository to reflect my growth as a programmer.
